            The darkness is overwhelming. It feels like you're swimming in a ocean of black. You try to turn your head, but it seems to be stuck. Suddenly a splash of cold in your face. Somewhere far away, you can hear voices. At the moment you become aware of them, they start to grow louder, until you can discern what they are saying: 'Is the traveler awake yet?' 'No, but the fever is down. Soon, I hope.' \r
            It takes an enormous effort, but slowly, you open your eyes. Just a bit, because the lights, although dim, hurt like the fires of the nine hells. \r
            As you try to get up, a gentle but firm hand pushes you back down: 'Calm down. You had a nasty bump to the head. Now, can you tell me who you are?' You search your mind for a name, but your mind comes up awfully blank. \r
            'Don't worry. It'll come back later. Let me get you some fresh water.' You hear a chair scraping the floor and the sound of rustling fabric. Two dark shapes leave the room. Once you're alone again, you open your eyes further, blinking against the light, and then, slowly, get up. Your head is pounding and it takes some time for the room to stop turning. \r

            You are in a small room, with wooden walls. Light comes in through a small window, giving you the opportunity to examine the simple yet sturdy furniture. \r
            The bed you sit on has a soft mattress and a comfortable wool blanket. Next to it is the chair your caretaker used to sit in. It has some simple but colourful decoration. \r
            Across the room is a desk, if you stretch your arm, you can almost touch it. On top of the desk you see a backpack and some other stuff, which you assume are your personal belongings. Propped up to the desk you see a weapon. Your weapon?""";
